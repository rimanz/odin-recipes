            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>
                This coconut rice recipe is so simple and delicious, itâ€™ll quickly
                become a go-to in your side dish rotation. While coconut rice can be
                found across the Asian continent and throughout the Pacific, this recipe
                takes inspiration from a traditional Malaysian recipe called Nasi lemak.
                Countries like Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia all have similar
                versions of coconut milk rice, so you can really explore the different
                ways to make it.

            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>
                    Place rice in a fine mesh strainer, and rinse with cold water,
                    stirring rice using your fingers to remove excess starch, until water
                    from rice runs clear, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt in a medium
                    saucepan; stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring mixture in saucepan to a boil over medium heat. Cover, reduce
                    heat to low, and simmer, undisturbed, for 11 minutes. Turn off heat;
                    steam, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 10
                    minutes. Uncover and gently stir in coconut oil.
